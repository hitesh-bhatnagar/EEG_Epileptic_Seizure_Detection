    <h1>AI/ML Project: CNN Binary Classification Model</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome to the repository for the CNN Binary Classification model project! This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for binary classification tasks.</p>
    
    <h2>Cloning the Repository</h2>
    
    <p>To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using Git Bash or your preferred terminal:</p>
    
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/hitesh-bhatnagar/EEG_Epileptic_Seizure_Detection.git
cd EEG_Epileptic_Seizure_Detection
</code></pre>
    
    <h2>Branches</h2>
    
    <p>This repository contains multiple branches, each serving different purposes. Below are the branches you can reference:</p>
    
    <h3><code>main</code> Branch</h3>
    
    <p>The <code>main</code> branch contains the stable version of the project. It is the default branch where you can find the latest tested and reviewed changes.</p>
    
    <pre><code>git checkout main
</code></pre>
    
    <h3><code>master</code> Branch (CNN Binary Classification Model)</h3>
    
    <p>The <code>master</code> branch specifically hosts the CNN Binary Classification model. You can access and use this branch to explore or integrate the CNN model into your projects.</p>
    
    <pre><code>git checkout master
</code></pre>
    
    <h2>CNN Binary Classification Model</h2>
    
    <p>The CNN Binary Classification model in the <code>master</code> branch achieves a validation accuracy of 55.16%. This model is trained to classify data into two distinct classes using convolutional layers.</p>
    
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    
    <p>You can integrate the CNN model into your own projects by cloning the repository and switching to the <code>master</code> branch as shown above. Refer to the model implementation and adapt it to your specific use case.</p>
